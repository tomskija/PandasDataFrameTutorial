## Pandas DataFrames Tutorial
#### Creating new project based on utilizing Pandas DataFrames to illustrate how to alter datasets and plot data
#### Data summary
This workflow demonstrated the process of data cleaning and creating a structured dataset to be used later on using Pandas DataFrames. You should have learned how to delete null values, replace 0 with negative values, select a series of data based on a conditional, how to work with dates and times, and how to find particular string and null values and then drop values not corresponding to those. You should have also learned how to create to an Excel file using Pandas DataFrames, and how to read that data back in given a particular Excel spreadsheet. You should have become familiar with the .join and the .conact usage in order to combine different Pandas DataFrames. You should have become familiar with how to access certain features, and several features from a given dataset/DataFrame at a time. You should have also become familiar with how to soft a DataFrame based on a certain feature, and how to reset the index afterwards such that the new value at index 0 corresponds to that index now and not its old index/row location. Lastly, you should have become familiar with how to plot various types of plots using Pandas DataFrame.
