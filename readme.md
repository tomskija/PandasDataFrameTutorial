## Pandas DataFrames Tutorial

#### Project Description:

This project demonstrates how to create one structured dataset from several doing a series of prepossessing steps specifically utilizing Pandas DataFrames. Once the prepossessing of the data is done, and a series of applications are shown using Pandas DataFrames, then various plots are illustrated utilizing Pandas DataFrames as an educational tool, especially for those who are geoscientists.

#### Project Requirements:

This project requires the following Python libraries to be installed in order to work.

* Numpy
* Pandas (along with scatter_matrix package)
* Os
* Shutil
* Functools
* Time
* Warnings (optional)
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib

Unfortunately, the project data cannot be supplied, but the code outlined in this workflow can be utilized to preprocess and edit whatever dataset or datasets you are utilizing on your given machine.

#### Project Results:

* This workflow demonstrated the process of data cleaning and creating a structured dataset to be used later on using Pandas DataFrames.
* You should have learned how to delete null values, replace 0 with negative values, select a series of data based on a conditional, how to work with dates and times, and how to find particular string and null values and then drop values not corresponding to those.
* You should have also learned how to write to an Excel file using Pandas DataFrames, and how to read that data back in given a particular Excel spreadsheet.
* You should have become familiar with the .join and the .conact usage in order to combine different Pandas DataFrames.
* You should have become familiar with how to access certain features, and several features from a given dataset/DataFrame at a time.
* You should have also become familiar with how to sort a DataFrame based on a certain feature, and how to reset the index afterwards such that the new value at index 0 corresponds to that index now and not its old index/row location.
* Lastly, you should have become familiar with how to plot various types of plots using Pandas DataFrame.
